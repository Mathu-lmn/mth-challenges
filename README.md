**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, today is the day I'm releasing the mth-challenges resource. I created this resource to add fun challenges to your server. You can create your own challenges and add them to the config file. This resource is standalone, which means that you don't need any dependencies to start it on your server.

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-challenges` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-challenges` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, have fun !

**Features :sparkles: :**
* You can add your own challenges and edit the existing ones
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use
* Leaderboard showing the top 3 players
* Results are shown
* You can opt out of the challenges with the command 'toggle_challenges'


*Demo :eyes:  :*
